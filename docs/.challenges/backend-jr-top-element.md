# Amano Challenge - Top Element
Time: 15 minutes recommended.

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, return the k most frequent elements.

Your solution must be better than O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the size of the array.

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2  
Output: [1,2]
```

```
Input: nums = [4,4,4,5,6,6,6,7], k = 1  
Output: [4] or [6]  (both are valid)
```

#### Conditions:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- k is always a valid integer: `1 <= k <= number` of unique elements
- You may return the answer in any order.
