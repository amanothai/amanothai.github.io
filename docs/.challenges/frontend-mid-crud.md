# Amano Challenge - Next Note CRUD
Time: 45 minutes recommended.

Evaluate deeper React/Next.js knowledge, API interaction, form handling, and modular code design.

Build a Note Manager that allows users to:
- View all notes.
- Add a new note.
- Delete an existing note.

Use mocked API routes via Next.js API (you donâ€™t need a database, just keep notes in memory).

## Requirements:
#### 1.	GET /api/notes
- Returns all notes.
#### 2.	POST /api/notes
- Accepts a title and description to create a new note.
#### 3.	DELETE /api/notes/:id
- Deletes a note by ID.
#### 4.	Frontend:
- Display the list of notes.
- Create note form with validation (title required, min 3 characters).
- Delete button for each note.
#### 5.	Optional (Bonus):
- Use react-hook-form for form management.
- Add optimistic UI (remove the note from the UI before waiting for the server response).
